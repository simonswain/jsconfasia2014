** Building an Internet of Things service, from silicon to cloud **

One of my gigs at the moment is at an IoT startup. We're building
everything from hardware to the cloud system the devices talk to. I'd
give a rundown on what the devices are, how they talk to the cloud,
and what you can do with them. The cloud app is top to bottom
Javascript. There are lots of interesting problems getting this
working for real.
